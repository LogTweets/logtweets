        Hola fellow DevOp, honestly, when was the last time you spend hours
        tackling a misbehaving system just to find out your collegue fixed the
        same issue the day before?
        Why was this setting changed and whom can I ask about it?
        And most important: who needs stick-beating? LogTweets helps you to keep
        track of who changed what on which system â€” without wasting anyones time.
